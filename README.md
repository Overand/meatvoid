# meatvoid
Meat Void - Userscript to replace vagina/vulva uphemisms.

## Introduction

A friend made a facebook post, suggesting that one replace all euphemisms for "vagina" with "meat void."  This script does so, and is set up to allow multiple replacements of this sort.

It's not very smart, but it works!

## How To Use

### WARNING 
Tthis script will slow down the loading of all web pages - make sure you disable it when you aren't using it!  Or, you may change the pages it is set to apply to in Greasemonkey / Tampermonkey.

### Install Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey

* Firefox users: Install [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)
* Google Chrome users: Install [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)

### Install meatvoid.user.js

* [Click here](https://github.com/Overand/meatvoid/raw/master/meatvoid.user.js) to install script
* Change settings to apply to whatever domains you wish to use
* *Warning* - this script will slow down the loading of all pages. Be sure to select only the relevant pages, or disable the script (or Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey) when not in use.

## TODO

* Case-sensitivity "fix"
** Get the capitalization right
* Performance improvements
* Smarter behavior around euphemisms like "poon" vs "poonany" (possibly just ordering in the list)
