# meatvoid
Meat Void - Userscript to replace vagina/vulva uphemisms.

## Introduction

A friend made a facebook post, suggesting that one replace all euphemisms for "vagina" with "meat void."  This script does so, and is set up to allow multiple replacements of this sort.

It's not very smart, but it works!

## TODO

* Case-sensitivity "fix"
** Get the capitalization right
* Performance improvements
* Smarter behavior around euphemisms like "poon" vs "poonany" (possibly just ordering in the list)
